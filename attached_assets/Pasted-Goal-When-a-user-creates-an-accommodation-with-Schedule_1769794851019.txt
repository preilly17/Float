Goal: When a user creates an accommodation with Schedule & Invite, it behaves like a booked plan with RSVPs. It must not create a “proposal” for the sender, and it must not allow “propose” actions after creation.

Implement the following behavior:

A) Creation behavior (Schedule & Invite)

In the Add Hotel/Accommodation Manually modal, when toggle = Schedule & Invite:

On submit, create the accommodation record as scheduled/booked (not proposed).

Immediately create a calendar event for the sender (the creator) without requiring any acceptance.

Send RSVP invites to the selected trip members (the same “Who’s going?” selector logic used for scheduled activities).

The sender must not see this item in Proposals (neither “My Proposals” nor “Hotels” tab).

B) Invitee behavior (Accept/Deny only)

For invitees, the RSVP invite should appear in their Proposals tab as an RSVP request with only:

Accept

Deny

No ranking, no interest voting.

If invitee Accepts:

Create/add the accommodation calendar event for that invitee.

Mark invite status accepted.

If invitee Denies:

Do not add to calendar.

Mark invite status denied.

C) Post-creation restrictions

For any accommodation created via Schedule & Invite:

Remove/disable any UI action that allows “Propose to group” after the fact.

The accommodation card should show status Scheduled/Booked and RSVP status summary (optional), but no propose button.

D) Constraints / do-not-break list

Do not change existing DB schema unless absolutely necessary; prefer reusing the existing proposal/invite models if they already exist.

Do not change the proposal ranking logic for hotels (that belongs to the proposal flow only).

Do not change other entity flows (flights/restaurants/activities) in this prompt.

E) Acceptance tests

Create manual hotel with Schedule & Invite:

Sender sees it on Calendar immediately.

Sender does not see it in Proposals.

Invitees see an RSVP item in Proposals with only Accept/Deny.

Accept adds to invitee calendar; Deny does not.

The hotel item does not show any “Propose” option afterward.

Implementation note: Search code for the accommodation manual modal component and the handler that currently creates proposals for hotels. Split logic by toggle state so Schedule & Invite writes to “scheduled/calendar + invites” path, and proposal path stays untouched.

TASK: Reorder the fields in the “Create an activity” modal UI ONLY. Do NOT change any existing behavior, validation, API payloads, default values, or state logic. This is a layout/ordering change only.

CURRENT CONTEXT:
- The form has a toggle at the top: “Schedule & Invite” (aka Save for Me) vs “Propose to Group”.
- All existing fields and features must remain exactly as-is (required fields still required, RSVP/proposal logic unchanged, who’s going selection unchanged, cost/max participants unchanged, etc.).
- Keep all current hooks/state names, form libs (react-hook-form/zod/etc.), and submit handlers intact.

NEW REQUIRED VISUAL ORDER (top → bottom):
1) Toggle for Scheduled vs Proposed (leave exactly as-is)
2) Activity Name
3) Date & Start Time (same row if it already is; keep same inputs/validators)
4) End Time (optional)
5) Location
6) Category
7) Description (optional)
8) Cost Per Person (optional)
9) Who’s Going (member selector)

IMPLEMENTATION INSTRUCTIONS:
1) Find the Activity creation modal/component (likely something like:
   - client/src/components/modals/CreateActivityModal.tsx
   - client/src/components/activities/ActivityForm.tsx
   - client/src/pages/calendar/* or similar)
2) Do NOT rewrite the form logic. Only move the JSX/markup blocks to match the order above.
   - Do not rename fields.
   - Do not change form registration keys (e.g., “name”, “date”, “startTime”, etc.).
   - Do not change conditional rendering rules tied to the toggle (scheduled vs proposed). If some fields currently show/hide by mode, keep that exact behavior—just move their position when visible.
3) Keep “Trip dates: …” helper text with the Date field (same as current).
4) Keep the submit button and footer where it currently lives.
5) Preserve spacing/styling (same components, same classes). If there’s a grid layout, just reorder within that layout without changing styling tokens.
6) Ensure keyboard tab order matches the new visual order.

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:
- Submitting in either mode produces the exact same payload as before (no key changes, no missing fields).
- Required/optional validations behave exactly the same.
- “Who’s going” selection and RSVP/proposal flow behaves exactly the same.
- Only the field order in the UI changes.

DELIVERABLE:
- Commit/change only the minimal code needed to reorder the form sections.
- After changes, show me the updated component diff (or paste the final component file) so I can verify ordering.

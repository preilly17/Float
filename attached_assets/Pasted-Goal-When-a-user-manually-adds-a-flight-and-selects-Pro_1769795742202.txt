Goal: When a user manually adds a flight and selects Propose to Group, it becomes an OPEN flight proposal for selected members to compare/rank. Only the proposal creator can convert the winning flight to scheduled. Conversion adds it to everyone’s calendar.

A) Creation behavior (Propose to Group)

In Add Flight Manually, when toggle = Propose to Group:

Create a flight proposal with status OPEN (or your equivalent).

It must appear for:

Invitees: Proposals → Flights

Creator: My Proposals (creator must be able to manage/convert it)

Ensure the proposal is delivered only to the selected members.

B) Voting behavior (Ranking)

For flight proposals:

Invitees can rank flight options (price/time/airline tradeoffs).

Store ranking per-user per-trip using your existing proposal ranking mechanism (do not reinvent).

C) Conversion behavior (creator-only)

Only the proposal creator can see Convert to Scheduled / Book this flight.

Other members do not see convert.

On convert:

Mark proposal as CLOSED/CONFIRMED/CONVERTED.

Create the scheduled flight item.

Create calendar events for:

creator

every member included in the proposal audience (use selected members as source of truth).

Remove it from active proposal lists (should not stay OPEN).

D) Post-conversion restrictions

After conversion:

Scheduled flight behaves like a scheduled plan: no voting, no ranking, no proposal actions.

Proposal becomes read-only/archived if still visible anywhere.

E) Constraints / do-not-break list

Don’t touch accommodations/activity/restaurant logic here.

Don’t break the existing proposal status filters (OPEN vs CONFIRMED). If flight proposals are disappearing, fix the status mapping so OPEN stays visible until conversion.

F) Acceptance tests

Manual flight + Propose:

Invitees see it under Flights proposals and can rank.

Creator sees it under My Proposals and can convert.

Non-creators cannot convert.

After conversion, it appears on everyone’s Calendar and is no longer an OPEN proposal.

Build/Refactor the “Packing List” page to match the attached screenshot design (layout, spacing, typography, and pastel gradient styling). Preserve current manual add functionality, but enforce correct privacy + per-user completion behavior.

UI / Layout (match screenshot)
- Left sidebar navigation already exists.
- Main card container:
  - Title row: “Packing Essentials” + a small badge like “1/4 packed”
  - Top-right: toggle button “Hide Completed”
  - Progress bar row:
    - Label “Progress”
    - Horizontal progress bar
    - Percent number on the right (e.g., 25%)
- Add item row:
  - Text input: “Add a packing item…”
  - Dropdown 1: category (default “General”)
  - Dropdown 2: scope/type (default “Personal”; options: Personal, Group)
  - Plus button on the far right to add
- Two sections stacked:
  1) Personal Items
     - Header shows “Personal Items” and a small badge “You: X/Y packed”
     - Items grouped by category with colored pill labels (e.g., Clothing, Toiletries)
  2) Group Items
     - Header shows “Group Items” and a small badge “You: X/Y handled”
     - Items grouped by category with colored pill labels (e.g., General, Documents)
- Item row styling:
  - Left: circular checkbox
  - Center: item name
  - If completed, show strikethrough and a small “✓ Packed” (or “✓ Handled” for group) sublabel
  - Right: show a small “person” label:
    - For personal items: show owner name (e.g., “Alec”)
    - For group items: show “Suggested by <name>”
  - Rightmost: trash icon button to delete item (only allowed for creator OR trip owner/admin)
- Hide Completed:
  - When enabled, hide completed items in BOTH sections for the current user only (do not delete).

Core behavior / rules
A) Personal Items (private)
- Personal items are visible ONLY to the current user.
- Other trip members must never see any of my personal items.
- Checking a personal item marks it complete for me.
- Completion does not remove the item; it stays visible unless “Hide Completed” is enabled.

B) Group Items (shared list, but completion is per-user)
- Group items are visible to all trip members as shared “don’t forget” reminders (passport, cash, etc.).
- IMPORTANT: When any user checks off a group item, it only affects THAT user’s completion state.
  - It must NOT mark the item complete for other members.
  - It must NOT change the shared group item record itself.
- For group items, display an optional aggregate progress indicator per item:
  - e.g., “Group: 0/3 handled” where 3 = number of trip members, and the numerator counts how many members have checked it off.
  - This is display-only aggregation; each user’s checkbox is still independent.
- Group items should say “Handled” (or “Packed”)—choose one and use consistently.

C) Progress counts
- Overall top badge “X/Y packed” and % should reflect the current user’s completion across:
  - All personal items (mine)
  - All group items (my per-user handled state)
- Personal section badge: “You: X/Y packed” based on my personal items only.
- Group section badge: “You: X/Y handled” based on my handled state across group items.
- Hide Completed should not affect the denominator (optional), but the UI should remain consistent; if it does change counts, do it intentionally and consistently.

Data model / implementation requirements (to avoid bugs)
You must model “Group item exists” separately from “User completed it”.

Suggested schema (can be Prisma or similar):
1) packing_items
- id
- tripId
- scope: 'PERSONAL' | 'GROUP'
- title
- category (string)
- createdByUserId
- createdAt
- deletedAt (optional soft delete)

2) packing_item_status (per-user completion)
- id
- tripId
- itemId
- userId
- completedAt (nullable)
- UNIQUE(itemId, userId)

Privacy enforcement:
- For PERSONAL scope, only allow read/write where userId == current user. Easiest:
  - Store PERSONAL items as scope=PERSONAL AND createdByUserId=current user
  - Filter server-side so other users never receive them.
- For GROUP scope, all members can read items, but status is per-user in packing_item_status.

API behavior
- GET packing items for trip:
  - Return group items for trip + the current user’s personal items
  - Include current user’s completion status for each item
  - Include optional aggregate completedCount for group items (for “Group: X/N handled”)
- POST create item:
  - If scope=PERSONAL, create personal item owned by current user
  - If scope=GROUP, create shared group item (visible to all)
- POST toggle completion:
  - For PERSONAL: update/create packing_item_status for current user
  - For GROUP: update/create packing_item_status for current user only
- DELETE item:
  - Only creator OR trip owner/admin can delete (enforce server-side)
  - Deleting an item removes it for everyone if GROUP, or only for owner if PERSONAL

Frontend state rules
- “Proposed/packed” UI must reflect server truth (do not fake completion in local state without persisting).
- On add/toggle/delete, refetch or invalidate cache so Personal/Group counts and progress bar update immediately.

Acceptance tests (must pass)
1) I add a personal item -> only I can see it; other member cannot.
2) I add a group item -> all members can see it.
3) I check off a group item -> only my checkbox becomes checked; other members remain unchecked.
4) Aggregate label “Group: X/N handled” increments when different users check it off.
5) Hide Completed hides completed items for me only without deleting them.
6) Top progress and section progress update correctly.

Match the screenshot’s look closely: soft pastel gradients, rounded cards, pill category labels, subtle shadows, and clean spacing.

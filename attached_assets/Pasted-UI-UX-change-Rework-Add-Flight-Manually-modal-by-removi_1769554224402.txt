UI/UX change: Rework “Add Flight Manually” modal by removing fields:
- Seat Class
- Flight Type
- Booking Reference

Requirements:
1) In the “Add Flight Manually” modal UI:
   - Remove the Seat Class dropdown entirely.
   - Remove the Flight Type dropdown entirely.
   - Remove the Booking Reference input entirely.
2) Do NOT break manual flight creation:
   - The flight creation request must still succeed even if backend currently expects these fields.
   - Ensure the payload sent to the backend is valid and consistent.

Implementation details:
A) Frontend form:
- Update the form schema / validation (zod/yup/whatever) to remove these fields.
- Remove them from defaultValues/state and from any submit transformation logic.
- Adjust layout so remaining fields look balanced (2-column grid still fine; remove empty gaps; keep spacing consistent).
- Ensure required fields remain required: flightNumber, airline, fromAirport, toAirport, departureTime, arrivalTime. Price remains optional.

B) API payload compatibility:
- If backend requires seatClass/flightType/bookingReference:
  - Provide safe defaults server-side or client-side without exposing fields in UI:
    - seatClass: null (preferred) or "Economy" if schema is non-nullable
    - flightType: null or "Outbound" if schema is non-nullable
    - bookingReference: null
- Prefer fixing backend to make these columns nullable and optional rather than sending fake values.

C) Backend (if needed):
- Update the flight create endpoint to treat these fields as optional.
- Update DB schema (migration) so seatClass, flightType, bookingReference are nullable / optional with no validation requirement.
- Ensure existing records still read correctly.

D) Cleanup:
- Remove any UI display dependencies that assume these fields exist (e.g., flight card showing seat class).
- If the flight card currently displays seat class or flight type, either remove it or display only when present.

Acceptance tests:
1) Create a manual flight using only the remaining fields -> 201 success.
2) Flight renders correctly in “Manually Added Flights” list.
3) No frontend validation errors about removed fields.
4) No backend errors about missing seatClass/flightType/bookingReference.

Deliverable:
- Commit with modal UI changes + any backend migration/validation changes required to keep creates working.

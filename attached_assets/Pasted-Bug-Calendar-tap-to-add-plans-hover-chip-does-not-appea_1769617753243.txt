Bug: Calendar “tap to add plans” hover chip does not appear on the LAST day of the trip.
Example trip dates: March 1–15, 2026. I can hover and add plans on days 1–14, but not on the 15th. The 15th should be included (inclusive end date).

Goal:
Make the calendar’s “within trip date range” logic treat the trip end date as INCLUSIVE, and remove any timezone mismatch that makes the last day fall outside the range.

What to do:
1) Locate the logic that determines whether a calendar day cell is “inTripRange” / “isWithinTripDates” / “isTripDay” and therefore can show the hover chip (“tap to add plans”).
   - Search for comparisons like:
     date >= tripStart && date < tripEnd
     isBefore(day, tripEnd)
     day.diff(end) < 0
     endDate exclusive checks
   - Also check any logic that creates the calendar grid and disables days outside the trip.

2) Fix the range comparison to be inclusive of the end date:
   - Correct logic:
     day >= startOfDay(tripStart) AND day <= endOfDay(tripEnd)
   - If using date-fns:
     isWithinInterval(day, { start: startOfDay(tripStart), end: endOfDay(tripEnd) })
   - If using dayjs/moment:
     day.isSameOrAfter(start, 'day') && day.isSameOrBefore(end, 'day')

3) Normalize timezones to prevent off-by-one-day:
   - Store and compare dates using a consistent basis:
     - Convert tripStart/tripEnd and cellDate to local “startOfDay” in the trip’s timezone OR just compare by date-only (YYYY-MM-DD).
   - Do NOT compare raw Date objects with times (e.g., tripEnd at 00:00) because it will exclude the end day.

4) Add a regression test / console validation:
   - Log or assert that:
     isTripDay(Mar 1, 2026) === true
     isTripDay(Mar 14, 2026) === true
     isTripDay(Mar 15, 2026) === true   <-- critical
     isTripDay(Mar 16, 2026) === false

5) Ensure UI behavior:
   - The hover chip appears on March 15 cell.
   - Clicking March 15 opens the “add plan” modal the same as other trip days.

Deliverable:
- Identify the exact function/file where range logic was wrong.
- Implement inclusive end-date logic with startOfDay/endOfDay normalization.
- Confirm by showing that March 15 now allows “tap to add plans.”

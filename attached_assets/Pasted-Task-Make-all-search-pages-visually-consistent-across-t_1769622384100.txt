Task: Make all “search” pages visually consistent across the app WITHOUT breaking any functionality.

Context:
Search UIs exist for Restaurants, Activities, Hotels/Stays, Flights (and any other search-like forms).
Right now they look inconsistent: different spacing, typography, extra helper text, mismatched button styles/colors, inconsistent icons usage, different date picker patterns, inconsistent “secondary actions” (external search links), etc.

Hard rule:
DO NOT change any business logic, API calls, query params, state shape, validation rules, or backend endpoints.
This is a UI/UX refactor only. Preserve existing behavior and data flow.

Approach (must follow):
1) Create a shared “SearchFormLayout” design system for all search pages:
   - A shared container/card layout with:
     - Title (H2)
     - Subtitle (1 line max)
     - Optional helper text area (same style everywhere)
     - Form grid (responsive: 2 columns desktop, 1 column mobile)
     - Primary CTA row (right-aligned primary button)
     - Secondary actions row (external links) styled consistently
   - Use the same padding, border radius, background, and shadow across all search pages.

2) Create shared UI components used by all search pages:
   - <SearchHeader title subtitle />
   - <FormGrid> and <FormRow>
   - <PrimaryButton> and <SecondaryButton> (one consistent gradient or one consistent solid—pick ONE and apply everywhere)
   - <FieldLabel>, <HelperText>
   - <DateRangeField> and <DateTimeField> wrappers so date selection UX is consistent
   - <ExternalLinkButtons> for “Search on X” type buttons (same style + icon usage)
   - Make icons consistent: either always show leading icon for CTAs or never. Choose one standard.

3) Normalize form conventions across pages:
   - Required fields show asterisk and same label style
   - Same input heights, same border color, same focus ring
   - Same spacing between sections (e.g. 24px)
   - Remove unnecessary/duplicative helper text or convert to tooltips/info blocks with the same component
   - Align CTA placement: Primary “Search” or “Search Restaurants/Hotels/Flights” on bottom right
   - Secondary actions (OpenTable/Resy/Viator/etc.) live under the form in a consistent “Book on trusted platforms” panel

4) Dates consistency (critical):
   - Choose ONE date UX pattern and apply across:
     - For Activities/Hotels: Date range picker
     - For Restaurants: single date + time (use same date picker component + time select)
     - For Flights: depart/return (date pickers) consistent styling and calendar behavior
   - Do NOT alter the underlying stored values—only wrap and style the existing inputs.

5) Do NOT break functionality:
   - Keep existing onChange handlers, submit handlers, form libraries (react-hook-form, etc.) intact.
   - If you replace markup, wire it to the same state/props.
   - Run through each search page and confirm searches still trigger exactly as before.

Deliverables:
A) Add shared components in a /components/search (or similar) folder.
B) Refactor these pages to use the shared layout:
   - Restaurants search page
   - Activities discover/search page
   - Hotels/Stays search page
   - Flights search page
   - Any other similar search pages found in codebase
C) Provide before/after notes listing:
   - Which components were introduced
   - Which pages were migrated
   - Confirmation that API calls and behaviors are unchanged

Acceptance checklist:
- All search pages share the same header styling, spacing, and container.
- All primary CTA buttons look identical across pages.
- All inputs share the same height, typography, border, and focus style.
- All date inputs use the same calendar component styling.
- Secondary/external platform buttons look identical across pages.
- No changes to network requests, query params, or submit behavior.

Goal: When a user creates an accommodation with Propose to Group, it becomes a ranked proposal for selected members. Members can rank options. Only the proposal creator can convert the winning option to scheduled. Conversion adds to everyone’s calendar.

Implement the following behavior:

A) Creation behavior (Propose to Group)

In the Add Hotel/Accommodation Manually modal, when toggle = Propose to Group:

Create an accommodation proposal with status OPEN (or your existing equivalent).

It must appear in:

Invitees’ Proposals → Hotels category

Creator’s My Proposals (not necessarily Hotels category if your app intentionally hides creator items there—BUT creator must be able to manage/convert it).

Ensure the proposal is delivered only to the selected members (respect the member selection list).

B) Voting behavior (Ranking)

For accommodation proposals:

Invitees can rank accommodation options inside their proposals tab.

Ranking should be stored per-user per-trip (use existing hotel ranking system if it exists; do not rewrite it).

C) Conversion behavior (creator-only)

Only the proposal creator can see the Convert to Scheduled / Book this action.

Other members must not see the convert button.

When creator converts:

Mark the proposal as CLOSED/CONFIRMED/CONVERTED (whichever your system uses).

Create the scheduled accommodation item.

Create calendar events for:

creator

every member included in the proposal audience (or every member who ranked it, depending on current product decision—use “selected members” as source of truth unless already implemented differently).

Remove it from active proposal lists (it shouldn’t still show as “open” after conversion).

D) Post-conversion restrictions

After conversion:

The scheduled accommodation should behave like a scheduled plan (no ranking; no proposal actions).

The proposal should be read-only/archived if still visible.

E) Constraints / do-not-break list

Do not alter Schedule & Invite flow in this prompt.

Do not change flights/restaurants/activity proposals.

Reuse existing “proposal status filters” so converted/confirmed proposals don’t disappear incorrectly before conversion.

F) Acceptance tests

Create hotel with Propose:

Invitees see it under Hotels proposals and can rank.

Creator sees it under My Proposals and can convert.

Non-creators cannot convert.

After conversion, it appears on everyone’s Calendar and is no longer an open proposal.

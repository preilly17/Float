You are working on TripSyncBeta. I need you to standardize what the create-form toggle means across ALL creation flows (Activity, Restaurant, Accommodation/Stay, Flight) and fix behavior to match the definitions below. Do NOT remove any existing core functionality; only adjust logic/UI copy as needed to make behavior correct and consistent.

TOGGLE MODES (single invariant across all forms)

1) “Save for Me” (rename label in UI to “Schedule & Invite” if possible, because the current label is misleading)
Meaning:
- This is for definitive plans that should immediately be put on the sender’s calendar and optionally sent to selected trip members as an RSVP invite.
- There is NO voting or ranking in this mode. Recipients only Accept or Decline.
Required behavior:
- On submit:
  - Create a scheduled event record immediately.
  - Automatically add it to the SENDER’S calendar (always).
  - If the user selects recipients, create RSVP invites for those recipients.
- Recipient flow:
  - Recipients see an RSVP request (not a proposal).
  - If recipient ACCEPTS → event is added to their calendar.
  - If recipient DECLINES → it is NOT added to their calendar.
- Visibility:
  - This item should appear in the Calendar view as “Scheduled/Confirmed” for the sender immediately.
  - It should NOT appear in the Proposals voting lists (Flights/Hotels/Activities/Restaurants proposals tabs).
- UX:
  - In this mode, show “Who’s going?” (recipient selector) and make it clear it’s an RSVP invite.
  - The sender is implicitly included by default and cannot be removed.

2) “Propose to Group”
Meaning:
- This is for non-final ideas/options (time/interest/price comparisons).
- This mode supports voting/ranking/interest, and then later conversion into a scheduled plan.
Required behavior:
- On submit:
  - Create a PROPOSAL record (status OPEN/PROPOSED) tied to selected trip members.
  - It must appear in:
    a) Recipients’ Proposals tab (their “My Proposals” and category tab),
    b) Sender’s “My Proposals”.
- Voting flow:
  - Recipients can vote/rank/indicate interest.
  - Proposals do NOT go on anyone’s calendar automatically.
- Conversion:
  - Proposal must have a clear “Convert to Scheduled” / “Confirm & Add to Calendar” action.
  - On conversion:
    - Create a scheduled event from the proposal.
    - Add to calendar for:
      - Either only voters who opted-in (if that’s your model), OR a selected subset at conversion time.
    - Close the proposal (status CONFIRMED/CLOSED) and remove it from OPEN proposal lists.

IMPLEMENTATION TASKS
A) Audit current create handlers for Flights/Hotels/Restaurants/Activities:
- Ensure Save/Schedule mode creates a scheduled event + RSVP invites, not a proposal.
- Ensure Propose mode creates a proposal record and is fetchable by recipients.

B) Fix proposal fetching and filtering so that:
- Flight proposals created by the user and sent to others ALWAYS show in “My Proposals”.
- Proposals assigned to recipients ALWAYS show in their Proposals tab.
- Do not hide proposals due to creator filtering unless explicitly intended and documented.

C) Add/verify these fields in the data model if missing (or map to existing equivalents):
- type: FLIGHT | STAY | RESTAURANT | ACTIVITY
- mode: RSVP | PROPOSAL (or status+scope that cleanly distinguishes)
- status: SCHEDULED/CONFIRMED vs OPEN/PROPOSED vs CLOSED/CANCELED
- recipients: userIds (for invites or proposal assignment)
- createdBy, tripId
- calendarEventId or linkage for scheduled items

D) UI/Copy:
- If you keep “Save for Me” text, add helper text that it actually means “Schedule & Invite”.
- Prefer renaming to “Schedule & Invite” and “Propose to Group” for clarity.

ACCEPTANCE TESTS (must pass)
1) Create Flight in Schedule & Invite mode, select 2 members:
- Sender immediately sees it on calendar.
- Both members receive RSVP.
- Accept adds to their calendar; decline does not.
- Nothing shows in proposal lists.

2) Create Flight in Propose mode, select 2 members:
- Both members see it in Proposals → Flights category and My Proposals.
- Sender sees it in My Proposals.
- Not on calendar.
- Convert to Scheduled adds to calendars per rule and closes proposal.

3) Manual creation must still work:
- Creating a manual flight/stay/etc must always persist correctly; only the mode changes how it’s distributed and whether it schedules immediately.

Start by locating the submit handlers and API endpoints used for:
- creating proposals,
- creating scheduled events / RSVPs,
- fetching proposals by trip+user.
Then implement the above invariants with minimal changes.
